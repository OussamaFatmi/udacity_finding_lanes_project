**Finding Lane Lines on the Road**

The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Make a pipeline that finds lane lines on the road
* Reflect on your work in a written report

### Reflection

### 1. Describe your pipeline. As part of the description, explain how you modified the draw_lines() function.

My pipeline consisted of 5 steps. 
First, I converted the images to grayscale, then I use gaussian_blur to smooth the image, then I detect the edges using Canny function, 
at this point it is very important to export edges detected (as an image) to see if the lane lines are fully detected or not. As I was not satisfied with the manual Canny threshold 
tuning I tried to find a way to automatically define those thresholds. The auto Canny  

In order to draw a single line on the left and right lanes, I modified the draw_lines() function by ...

If you'd like to include images to show how the pipeline works, here is how to include an image:
